# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes
The site consists of a main index page that has a few links to recipes.
In this project I will practice my creation of HTML sites, hyperlinks and overall understanding of how HTML works.
All of this is from The Odin Project.

I made three different links in the main page that lead to different recipes of popular dishes that are my favourite.
I only had to look up for something once and that was how to center the images because margin-left/right was not working but apparently I needed to add display: block as well in order for the margins to work properly.
